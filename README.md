The Anti-`#region` Legion
=========================

The Anti-`#region` Legion is a community for people that believe that the `C#` [`#region`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9a1ybwek%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) is a unfortunate language construct. 

If you just love your regions The Anti-`#region` Legion is probably not for you. But it is suggested that you read [Richard Banks post on some of the issues with regions](http://www.richard-banks.org/2011/02/anti-region-campaign.html).

History
-------

The idea for the anti-`#region` legion started from a [twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/jrusbatch/status/392473615557746688) which again was started from [Microsoft declining to remove `#regions` from c#](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2678342-region-directive-considered-harmful-was-get-rid).
