But it is suggested that you read [Richard Banks post on some of the issues with regions](http://www.richard-banks.org/2011/02/anti-region-campaign.html).\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I join the Legion?\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nYou join by starring this repository. \r\n\r\nHistory\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe idea for the anti-`#region` legion started from a [twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/jrusbatch/status/392473615557746688) which again was started from [Microsoft declining to remove `#regions` from c#](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2678342-region-directive-considered-harmful-was-get-rid). \r\n\r\n\r\n**Join the anti-`#region` Legion today!**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
